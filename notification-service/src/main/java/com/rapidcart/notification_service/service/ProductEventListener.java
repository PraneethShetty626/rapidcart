/**
 * {@code ProductEventListener} is a Spring service responsible for listening to
 * product-related events from a RabbitMQ queue and triggering appropriate
 * notification actions based on the event type.
 *
 * <p>This listener consumes messages from the {@code product.events.queue},
 * which are published by other microservices (e.g., Order Service) via a
 * {@code TopicExchange}. Upon receiving an event, it validates the event type
 * and performs notification logic accordingly.</p>
 *
 * <p>Currently, it handles the {@code ORDER_CREATED} event type and logs a
 * notification message. In a real-world scenario, this can be extended to
 * send notifications through various channels such as email, SMS, or push
 * notifications.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Example usage:</strong></p>
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "eventType": "ORDER_CREATED",
 *   "data": {
 *     "id": 1,
 *     "productName": "iPhone 16 Pro",
 *     "quantity": 2,
 *     "totalPrice": 2999.98
 *   },
 *   "timestamp": "2025-10-31T12:00:00"
